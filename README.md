# Usage
Get the newest build from releases. Right click > open. If you see a dialog asking for mic permissions just ignore it; AVFoundation, which plays the song, also handles audio recording but it isn't used here

# Building
Open the project in Xcode and hit `Command + B`. Press `Product > Show Build Folder in Finder`
